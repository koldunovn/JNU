# GLACINDIA training program, New Delhi, India, 08-10 April, 2015.

Here you will find notebooks that we use during GLACINDIA training program. 

To download all notebooks and related data use [this link](https://github.com/koldunovn/JNU/archive/master.zip) Put downloaded file in to your user folder and unzip it.

## Installation instructions (Windows)

- First you have to download and install Anaconda python distribution for your system from [here](http://continuum.io/downloads). If installation is sucessful, you will be able to work with notebooks from 02 to 07. In order to work with `netCDF` files and `Basemap` some additional steps are required.

- Go to start menu, choose `run` and execute `cmd` in order to bring up windows command line.
- Change to `Anaconda\Scripts` directory by executing `cd Anaconda\Scripts`
- execute `conda install netcdf4 basemap` and agree with installation
- in order to make all examples to work we have to downgrade pandas to version 0.15.2. For this execute `conda install pandas=0.15.2`

## Running

- Go to start menu, find Anaconda folder, and run IPython notebook from this folder. IPython dashboard should open in your user folder. Go to JNU folder, that you already have dounloaded and unziped, and select folder with the notebook that you interested in.

##Learning python
If you become interested in python and would like to continue, you wll find couple of links below. Plese note, that at the end of some of the notebooks there are also some links on specific topics.

**Remember, the best way to learn programming is to write programs. Try to select some problem and solve it with python**
